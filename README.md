# Timesheet Android application

Timesheet is an application designed primarily for contractors and freelancers to track the time spent on different tasks.

You can add billable tasks and unbillable tasks (such as "Lunch") and get a daily or weekly report of time spent on each.

With the release of version 1.6 you can track the time automatically based on Wifi or Bluetooth connection state.
